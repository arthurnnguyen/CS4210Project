Problem Statement: In Los Angeles County, fluctuating shelter occupancy rates pose challenges for resource allocation and service planning. This project aims to identify key factors influencing shelter occupancy across the county and develop a model to anticipate future trends. By leveraging historical data and relevant socioeconomic indicators, this research seeks to provide data-driven insights to help shelters and policymakers optimize support for individuals experiencing homelessness
